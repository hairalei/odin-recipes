    <p>
      When I moved from Lebanon to Florida spring of 1999, I brought with me my
      love for cooking and search for new recipes. The famous key lime pie was
      new to me. It was a friend's best dessert, and he used to buy it from
      Costco every time we go for shopping. I tasted the pie at several places,
      but they were missing that wow flavor. I kept playing with the recipe, and
      the right flavor is found. I live now in North Bay, Ontario, and we only
      get the Key Limes twice a year, so sometimes I substitute with fresh lime
      juice. I hope you all enjoy!!
