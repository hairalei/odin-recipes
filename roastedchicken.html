    <p>
      My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to
      do it this way all the time. I never have had a chicken this juicy before;
      this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. It's
      funny. We nibble on the celery after.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>Â½ cup margarine, divided</li>
      <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out
        with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder.
      </li>
      <li>Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity.</li>
      <li>
        Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's
        exterior.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the
        bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the
        thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover
        with aluminum foil and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
